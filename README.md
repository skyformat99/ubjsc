What it is
==========

Ubjsc is a port to C of my pure 100% Python-3.x library for dealing with [UBJSON](http://ubjson.org/) format.

Someday I will prepare some mature docs of how to build it. Till then, be prepared to deal with dragons here.

For now, the library involves gcc toolchain, [cmake](https://cmake.org/), [conan](https://conan.io/) (but I do not know why yet).
