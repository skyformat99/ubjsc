 *
 *  After this returns, it is guaranteed that (*pret) is equal to either UTRUE/UFALSE,
 *  depending on these conditions:
 *
 *  - If the minors are 0, and the minors match, UTRUE, else UFALSE.
 *
 *    Aka your code built with version 0.1.0 is compatible with library runtime 0.1.2,
 *    but 0.1.0 is not compatible with 0.2.0.
 *  - Otherwise if the majors match, UTRUE, else UFALSE.
 *
 *    Aka 1.0.0 and 1.2.0 are good. The newer library probably will have more features than
 *    the one used in your project at the time of compilation.
 *    But 2.0.0 and 3.0.0 are not compatible. The API changed and you must either fallback to
 *    older version, or realign your code to fit the new library.
 *
 *  \param version Pointer under which to place library version.
 *  \param pret Pointer under which to place the result.
